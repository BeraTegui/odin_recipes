# Recipes Project - Brief Introduction
    The aim of this project (at least for me) is to refresh all the basic concepts of html when creating the basis of a webpage: The text hierarchy, inserting images, anchor tags and all the rest. The idea is to make this fully conscious made and not just copying the code that the TOP lesson provides.

# Objectives of the Recipe Project
    - Refresh the basic html structure of a webpage
    - Fasten the process of creating the basic structure of a website
    - Understand the different parts in which the page will be splitted (heading, body and footer)
    - Don't get tempted to add style to this page now, since it will be done later in the curriculum
